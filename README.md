This will check that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed and ask you to install it if you have not done so. Then, it will build a container that has Python 3.6 and all necessary dependencies. Finally, it will generate outputs from the Evaluation section and save them to the `./outputs` folder.
